#### phase 1 :
A multi-layer neural network model for predicting customer satisfaction with travel.

#### phase 2, 3 :
this code demonstrates the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) models to approximate a mathematical function with and without added noise. It illustrates the impact of noise on model performance and evaluates the models' accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

#### phase 6 : 
In this phase I've implemented a convolutional autoencoder using TensorFlow and Keras to denoise images from the MNIST dataset. It applies Gaussian noise to the images, trains the autoencoder model with K-Fold cross-validation, and then uses the trained model to denoise the testing images. Finally, it visualizes the original, noisy, and denoised images for comparison, showcasing the model's ability to effectively remove noise while preserving image quality.
